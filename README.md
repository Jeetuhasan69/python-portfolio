## Introduction

This portfolio is a testament to my journey in data analysis and visualization using Python. It includes various projects that demonstrate my ability to handle real-world datasets. Each project focuses on a specific aspect of data analysis, whether it's extracting data from APIs, visualizing trends, or building interactive web applications.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies are used throughout the projects in this portfolio:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Flask**: For building web applications.
- **Jinja2**: For templating in Flask.
- **SQLAlchemy**: For database interactions.
- **JSON**: For data interchange.
- **Web Scraping**: For gathering data from websites.

## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup

In this project, I built a web scraper using BeautifulSoup to extract data from a popular website. The scraper collects information about various products, including their prices and ratings. The data is then cleaned and stored in a CSV file for further analysis.

### Project 2: Data Visualization with Matplotlib

This project focuses on creating various types of plots using Matplotlib. I visualized data trends and patterns, including line graphs, bar charts, and scatter plots. The project emphasizes the importance of effective data visualization in conveying information clearly.

### Project 3: Interactive Dashboards with Flask

I developed an interactive web application using Flask that allows users to explore datasets through dynamic visualizations. Users can filter data and view different types of charts, enhancing their understanding of the underlying trends.

### Project 4: Analyzing COVID-19 Data

In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 data from various sources. I used Pandas for data manipulation and created visualizations to show the spread of the virus over time. The project highlights the importance of data analysis in understanding public health issues.

### Project 5: SQL Database Integration

This project demonstrates how to integrate SQL databases with Python applications using SQLAlchemy. I built a simple application that stores user data in a database and retrieves it for analysis. This project emphasizes the importance of data storage and retrieval in data-driven applications.
