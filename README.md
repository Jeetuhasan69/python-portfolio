🌟 Vonschell's Project Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of programming projects! This collection showcases a range of apps and data visualizations I’ve built using Python, Flask, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and more. From creative drawing tools and web apps to insightful data visualizations, each project reflects a milestone in my learning journey.

🧠 Projects

1. 🌐 Language Translator
GitHub Repo
An English-to-Spanish and French translation app that uses a CSV-powered dictionary. Features interactive user prompts and error handling for unknown words.

2. 📝 Personal Assistant
GitHub Repo
A command-line assistant that helps manage to-do lists and contacts. Built with Python classes and JSON file storage for persistent data between sessions.

3. 🎨 Drawing App
GitHub Repo
Create fun shapes like stars, hexagons, and squares using the Turtle graphics module. Demonstrates loop usage and modular function design for shape generation.

4. 🐶 Dog Photo Gallery
Live Site
A Flask web app that fetches and displays 30 images from over 100 dog breeds using a dropdown selector. Implements GET and POST methods with dynamic image rendering.

5. 🃏 Female Supervillain Trading Card App
Live Site
A full-stack CRUD Flask app to create and manage fictional female supervillain trading cards. Features RESTful APIs, SQLAlchemy, form validation, and Jinja2 templating.

6. 🔁 Refactored Female Supervillain Trading Card App
Live Site
A cleaner, more robust version of the supervillain card app — featuring the same full-stack capabilities, with improved structure and responsiveness.

7. 🚢 Surviving the Titanic Scatterplot
GitHub Repo
A scatter plot using Seaborn to visualize Titanic passenger data and examine survival based on fare and age. Clean, simple insights from complex data.

8. 💬 Comparing Happiness and Hard Work Bubble Plot
GitHub Repo
A vibrant bubble plot showing the relationship between salary and happiness scores. Demonstrates advanced use of Seaborn's scatterplot() with hue, size, and sizes.

9. 🐾 Animal Conservation Mosaic Plot
GitHub Repo
Visualizes the conservation statuses of animals (Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia) with a mosaic plot using Statsmodels. Highlights the urgency around vulnerable and endangered species.
